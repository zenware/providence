# Providence

## What it Is
This is a frontend to a service I'm planning to write in Go which monitors the response times of Public DNS Servers. I've also written a barebones command-line tool called [dnsanalyzergo](https://www.github.com/zenware/dnsanalyzergo) which I'm extracting into a library to use as part of the backend.

## How it Looks
